    <p>
    We were both young when I first saw you<br>
    I close my eyes and the flashback starts<br>
    I'm standin' there<br>
    On a balcony in summer air<br>
    See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns<br>
    See you make your way through the crowd<br>
    And say, "Hello"
    Little did I know
    </p>
    
    <p>That you were <a id="romeo" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet">Romeo</a>, you were throwing pebbles<br>
    And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"<br>
    And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"<br>
    And I was cryin' on the staircase<br>
    Beggin' you, "Please don't go," and I said
    </p>
    <p class="chorus">
    Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone<br>
    I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run<br>
    You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess<br>
    It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
    </p>
    <p>
    So I sneak out to the garden to see you<br>
    We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew<br>
    So close your eyes<br>
    Escape this town for a little while, oh oh<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    'Cause you were Romeo, I was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarlet_Letter">Scarlet Letter</a><br>
    And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"<br>
    But you were everything to me<br>
    I was beggin' you, "Please don't go, " and I said
    </p>
    <p class="chorus">
    Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone<br>
    I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run<br>
    You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess<br>
    It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel<br>
    This love is difficult, but it's real<br>
    Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess<br>
    It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"<br>
    Oh, oh<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    I got tired of waiting<br>
    Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around<br>
    My faith in you was fading<br>
    When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
    </p>
    <p>
    Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone<br>
    I keep waiting for you, but you never come<br>
    Is this in my head? I don't know what to think<br>
    He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    And said, "Marry me, Juliet<br>
    You'll never have to be alone<br>
    I love you and that's all I really know<br>
    I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress<br>
    It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"<br>
    Oh, oh, oh<br>
    Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
    'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
